        I am originally from the Omaha area.  I received my BS in Electrical Engineering from UNL. I got married while in college. We have 2 adult children that both work here in Omaha at the same
        company.  It is so funny to hear them complain about some random work-related meeting they both attended.  Kids
        are awesome.  I highly recommend them.  :-)  <br>
        We also have two awesome dogs. We have a 9 year-old rescue greyhound (Si) and another 3 year-old rescue hound (Moose).
        Moose is a scottish deer hound, and he is even bigger than our greyhound.  Moose weighs in at a little over 100 lbs.
        <br>
        I started my career in the hardware/electrical engineering field, then developed client/server software on UNIX
        systems, worked with early web-based transaction processing systems (anyone remember Netscape?), and developed fault-
        tolerant, highly-available systems prior to moving into Program Management.  While in Program Management, I led
        multiple development contracts with large teams of systems, software, and test engineers.  I also led rapid
        prototyping of emergent technologies for new business development that included demonstrations of prototypes to
        customers, and worked on several international projects.
